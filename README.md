<h1 align="center">Welcome to Testing in JavaScript 👋</h1>
<br>

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

In this project we adapted [Test-driven development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) to implement a few basic functionalities including: basic binary operations, string reversal, basic array analysis and the age-old [caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

The full project requirements can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice).
